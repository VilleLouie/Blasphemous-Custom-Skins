Hi, I have a problem. I want to play with my custom skins, but when I start the game from the mod installer I get this error: "Could not find configuration file in C:/Games/Blasphemous/doorstep_config.ini"
Please note that I disabled my antivirus when unzipping and installing the Blazmodinstaller.
If you could help me, I would be more than grateful. You can contact me through my Instagram profile @vvklaus_
